# mthirani-repl
A Java REPL project
This project provides the Java capability of dynamic compilation, class loaders, and simple lexical analysis (matching nested structures). The project demonstrates that Java can be extremely dynamic. Servers use this technology all the time to reload classes without having to restart the server program. Thus, we build a read-eval-print loop (REPL) interface or an interactive shell for Java code.
